                   <strong>Senior Cyber Security Recruitment Consultant</strong> <br>
                   <em>Hays</em> <br>
                   I learned as much as I could about Cyber Security because I have always been interested in tech. This allowed me to offer real value to my clients and candidates with my subject matter expertise, because I could often understand exactly what they needed and make it a reality for them. This contributed to my success in the role and I built an entirely new desk on my own in Manchester. I had great success and built some lifelong client relationships.
